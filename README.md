# Regression Analysis Projects

## Overview
This repository contains various regression analysis projects that demonstrate how to apply linear regression techniques to real-world datasets. The projects are implemented in Jupyter Notebooks using Python and include detailed steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Contents
- **Datasets**
  - `CarPrice_Assignment.csv`: Contains car price data for regression analysis.
  - `advertising.csv`: Contains advertising data for sales prediction.
- **Notebooks**
  - `Car_Price_Regg.ipynb`: Regression analysis on car price data.
  - `Sales_Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Linear regression on advertising data to predict sales.

## Project Descriptions
### 1. Car Price Regression
**Notebook**: `Car_Price_Regg.ipynb`

This project involves predicting car prices based on various features such as engine size, horsepower, and brand. The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building and training the regression model
- Model evaluation using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Visualization of results

### 2. Sales Prediction Using Linear Regression
**Notebook**: `Sales_Linear_Regression.ipynb`

This project aims to predict sales based on advertising spends across different media channels. The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building and training the linear regression model
- Model evaluation using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Visualization of results

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
